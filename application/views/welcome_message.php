After a successful  2nd Edition, Biofest returns with its 3rd Edition with many more exciting  events for students to identify and showcase their talent. Through Biofest, the annual technical festival of the Department of Biotechnology, IIT Madras, we intend to celebrate this great discipline that has enlightened us for centuries and has applications in every aspect of life. We endeavour to indulge the enthusiasts, learn from the learned, and teach those with an open mind. We hope to inculcate a passion for this discipline and provide a platform for students and researchers alike to showcase their illustrious work.
