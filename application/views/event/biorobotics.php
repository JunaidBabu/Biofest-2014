        <p>Biofest 2013 brings you the most exciting and diverse fields of engineering together through biorobotics. Biorobotics encompasses a diverse array of disciplines with a myriad of applications and deals with finding the simplest explanations for the intelligent behaviour of living organisms.</p><p>This year bio-robotics focuses on one of the most important application of robotics, the medical field. In every field of medicine it is a growing need to substitute hands on with robotics in various highly complicated surgeries of sensitive regions like brain, heart, etc. Bio-robotics deals with presenting an optimum, elegant and simple solution for surgeons to control machines without the slightest error. This event aims at exploring for the prime mechanism of various tasks that are tedious and sensitive to human hand.</p>
